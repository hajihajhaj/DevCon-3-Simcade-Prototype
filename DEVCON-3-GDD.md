# Playtest Feedback Summary

## Round 1 Feedback

### Key Points:
#### Ball Mechanics:
- Feels like a ping pong ball but needs sound for bouncing.
- Ball speed is too fast, making it difficult to hit targets.
- Ball is bouncy and realistic, but the speed and lack of sound take away from the experience.
- **Suggestions:**
  - Add sound effects for the ball.
  - Reduce the ball's speed.

#### Targets:
- Targets can’t be tested because the ball doesn’t hit them due to its speed.
- Targets are floating off the walls; they should spawn properly against the walls.

#### Scoring System:
- Score was not functioning in this round.

#### End Screen:
- Requires fixing (the mouse disappears so you're unable to press restart).
- The final score doesnt update.

#### Gameplay Adjustments:
- Add bumpers in the corners to prevent the ball from getting stuck.
- Reduce ball speed for better gameplay flow.

### Overall Impression:
- Gameplay is **pretty good** but needs significant improvements to refine mechanics and fix issues.

## Round 2 Feedback

### Key Points:
#### Table and Space:
- The table feels too small, limiting gameplay.
- The space is cramped and needs adjustments for better flow.

#### Ball Mechanics:
- Ball is too fast and feels more like a bouncy ball than a ping pong ball.
- The physics are off; the ball should hit the table once, then the wall, and not bounce excessively.
- Ball and paddle interaction needs to feel more realistic.
- **Suggestions:**
  - Adjust ball physics for realistic ping pong behavior.

#### Paddle Mechanics:
- Paddle positioning feels static; it should move dynamically (e.g., side-to-side).

#### End Screen:
- Still needs fixing.

#### Help Screen:
- The help screen was well-received.

### Overall Impression:
- Ball physics, Paddle movement and space need further improvement.

## Progress Updates
- Made the table bigger.
- Slowed the ball down.
- Added sound effects for the ball.
- Fixed targets so they no longer float off the sides.
- Added bumpers in the corners to prevent the ball from getting stuck.
- Fixed the scoring system so it now works as intended.

## Next Steps
1. Continue adjusting ball physics for realistic ping pong behavior.
2. Refine paddle mechanics to allow dynamic movement.
3. Improve the end screen.
